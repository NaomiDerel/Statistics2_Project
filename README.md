# Statistical Analysis of Cardiovascular Disease Dataset

A 5-part project for Statistics 2 course at Technion, covering exploration and statistical analysis for cardiovascular diseases dataset from 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset?resource=download).

## Part 1: Data Exploration

In this part we will explore the dataset, understand the data and its features, select relevant columns and preform some basic transformations, and lastly suggest some research questions.

## Part 2: Estimation and Hypothesis Testing

In this part we will preform hypothesis testing and estimation for the dataset, including confidence intervals, t-tests, and chi-square tests.

## Part 3: Regression Analysis

In this part we will preform linear and logistic regression analysis on the dataset, and evaluate the models.

## Part 4: Bootstrapping

In this part we will utilize bootstrapping to preform regression analysis and hypothesis testing on the dataset.

## Part 5: Bayesian Approach and Handeling Missing Data

For the bayesian approach, we will repeat estimation and analysis using tools from the Bayesian statistics. For the missing data, we will create missings in the dataset ans try to handle them using different impuation methods.
